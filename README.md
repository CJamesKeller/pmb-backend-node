# PRACTICE MAKES BETTER

## PLAN OF ATTACK, BACKEND

* (*Required project init stuff*)
* We want a visual interface with some data, so first, what data?
* To have data, we need a place to have it
* For consistency's sake, let's use a common space
* [ ] **Docker image**
* [ ] **Postgres on Docker**
* [ ] **Create test data for DB**
* [ ] **Confirm basic in & out commands, and set in files/scripts**
* Ok now we have data we can access, so we need to actually do that
* [ ] **Service to insert data and then to retrieve - Test def first**
* But now let's do it from the browser
* [ ] **Basic node server**
* [ ] **Initialize data on start**
* [ ] **Read-only endpoint**
* Hey wait, we don't want just anyone doing this
* [ ] **Add users table**
* [ ] **Add auth (hardcoded/pre-configured)**
* Sweet. Now more could be done to allow user to add, modify, delete.
* But let's just leave it at "could" for that.
